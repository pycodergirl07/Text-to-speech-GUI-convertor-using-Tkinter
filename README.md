# Text-to-speech-GUI-convertor-using-Tkinter
GUI based Text to speech convertor application  converts text into speech

Prerequisite: Introduction to Tkinter

Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.By this library we can make a compelling choice for building GUI applications in Python, especially for applications where a modern sheen is unnecessary, and the top priority is to build something that’s functional and cross-platform quickly.

To create a tkinter application:

Importing the module – tkinter
Create the main window (container)
Add any number of widgets to the main window
Apply the event Trigger on the widgets.
Now, Let’s create a GUI based Text to speech convertor application which convert text into speech.

There are lots of library in python one of them is gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate’s text-to-speech API.  

ALSO VICE VERSA
I.E Convert Speech to text and text to Speech

Speech Recognition is an important feature in several applications used such as home automation, artificial intelligence, etc. This article aims to provide an introduction on how to make use of the SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 library of Python.

Speech Input Using a Microphone and Translation of Speech to Text

Allow Adjusting for Ambient Noise: Since the surrounding noise varies, we must allow the program a second or too to adjust the energy threshold of recording so it is adjusted according to the external noise level.
Speech to text translation: This is done with the help of Google Speech Recognition. This requires an active internet connection to work. However, there are certain offline Recognition systems such as PocketSphinx, but have a very rigorous installation process that requires several dependencies. Google Speech Recognition is one of the easiest to use.
