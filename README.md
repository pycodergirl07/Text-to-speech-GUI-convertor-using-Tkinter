# Text-to-speech-GUI-convertor-using-Tkinter
GUI based Text to speech convertor application  converts text into speech

Prerequisite: Introduction to Tkinter

Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.By this library we can make a compelling choice for building GUI applications in Python, especially for applications where a modern sheen is unnecessary, and the top priority is to build something that’s functional and cross-platform quickly.

To create a tkinter application:

Importing the module – tkinter
Create the main window (container)
Add any number of widgets to the main window
Apply the event Trigger on the widgets.
Now, Let’s create a GUI based Text to speech convertor application which convert text into speech.

There are lots of library in python one of them is gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate’s text-to-speech API.
